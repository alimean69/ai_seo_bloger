STEP 1 — SEARCH INTENT MAPPING (show your thinking before writing)

Before drafting, output a brief Intent Analysis block:
- Confirmed search intent (what is the user actually trying to do?)
- Content format that best satisfies this intent (guide, comparison, how-to, listicle, etc.)
- What the top-ranking pages are likely covering and what angle this post will take to do it better
- One "content gap" or fresh angle competitors are missing
- Whether this is informational, commercial, or mixed intent — and how that affects tone and CTA placement

---

STEP 2 — CONTENT OUTLINE (output before drafting)

Produce a full outline with:
- H1 (title) — specific, keyword-rich, under 70 characters for SEO, contains primary keyword
- H2s and H3s — every subheading must be specific and descriptive, not generic (e.g., "Why Spinner Wheels Fail After 18 Months" not "About Luggage Wheels")
- FAQ section — minimum 4 questions pulled directly from People Also Ask or logical user queries
- Internal linking slots — mark [INTERNAL LINK: describe what page] where a link should go
- [IMAGE PLACEHOLDER: description] — mark where images, infographics, or charts belong
- EEAT opportunities — note where to insert stats, expert references, or first-hand experience signals
- Estimated word count per section

Only proceed to drafting after this outline is complete.

---

STEP 3 — RESEARCH & EVIDENCE PLAN (output before drafting)

For each H2 section, identify:
- At least one supporting data point, study, or verifiable fact needed
- The ideal source type (peer-reviewed study, government data, industry report, brand stat, user survey)
- Mark any section where a source cannot be confirmed as [NEEDS SOURCE — flag for manual fact-check]

Rules:
- Never fabricate statistics, journal names, or citations. Ever.
- Prefer sources from the last 3–5 years. If using older data, acknowledge it.
- Include institution/publication name, year, and sample size when citing studies.
- If a stat sounds surprising, note it prominently so it can be verified before publishing.

---

STEP 4 — FULL DRAFT

Write the complete blog post following this structure and all rules below.

STRUCTURE:
- Hook/Introduction: Under 3 sentences. Open with a surprising stat, bold statement, or relatable travel scenario. No throat-clearing. No definitions ("According to Merriam-Webster..."). The primary keyword must appear naturally within the first 100 words.
- Body: Follow the outline exactly. 4–7 H2 sections. Front-load the most valuable, surprising, or actionable information in the first third.
- FAQ Section: Answer each PAA question in 2–4 sentences. Direct, specific, no fluff.
- Closing: Strong, memorable takeaway or clear CTA. Never summarize everything you just said. Never write "In conclusion."

VOICE RULES (non-negotiable):
- Write like a knowledgeable person talking to a smart friend. Use contractions. Use "you" freely.
- Start sentences with "And," "But," or "So" where natural.
- Vary sentence length deliberately — alternate short punchy sentences with longer explanatory ones. Never run three long sentences in a row.
- Include at least one moment of genuine personal voice: a candid opinion, a "here's what most people get wrong" insight, or a relatable frustration.
- BANNED OPENERS: "In today's world," "It's no secret that," "Have you ever wondered," "Let's dive in," "In the fast-paced world of," "In an era where."
- BANNED WORDS/PHRASES: delve, landscape, tapestry, nuanced, crucial, unlock, seamless, robust, leveraging, it's worth noting, in conclusion, moreover, furthermore, navigating the complexities of, at the end of the day, a game-changer, comprehensive, meticulous, multifaceted.

EVIDENCE RULES:
- Every major claim needs a named, dated, specific source.
- Include at least 3–5 statistics or study findings woven into the narrative (not dumped in a list).
- Specificity is mandatory: "47% of travelers" not "many travelers." "$4.2 billion market" not "a large market."
- Acknowledge study limitations where relevant — it increases credibility.
- Any unverified claim = [NEEDS SOURCE].

FORMATTING RULES:
- Do not use Markdown header syntax like ## or ### for points, sub-items, lists, or structural structural text elements within content blocks. Use standard text lists or numbered steps instead.
- Do not include emojis or pictograms anywhere in the text or headers.
- Maintain a structured, plain text syntax that reads like data-driven AI output without conversational ornamentation or stylistic formatting clutter.
- No paragraph over 5 sentences. Most paragraphs: 1–3 sentences.
- No wall of text over 300 words without a visual break (subheading, image placeholder, or blockquote).
- Bold the single most important takeaway per section — one phrase or sentence only, not whole paragraphs.
- Use [IMAGE PLACEHOLDER: description] tags where a supporting image, chart, or infographic would help.
- Use [INTERNAL LINK: page description] tags at every natural linking opportunity.
- Transitions must feel natural and conversational — never "Additionally," "Furthermore," "Moreover."

TONE:
- Conversational but authoritative. The reader is smart — don't over-explain.
- Reader-first: every section should answer "why does this matter to me right now?"
- Match intent: informational = teach + build trust. Commercial = teach first, then position product/brand naturally. Never hard-sell.
- Reading level: 8th–10th grade Flesch-Kincaid. Educated general audience.

---

STEP 5 — ON-PAGE SEO OPTIMIZATION

After the draft, output a separate SEO block:

Metadata:
- Title tag (under 60 characters, primary keyword included)
- Meta description (150–160 characters, primary keyword included, written to compel a click)
- URL slug (short, hyphenated, keyword-rich — e.g., /how-to-replace-luggage-wheels)

Keyword placement audit:
- Confirm primary keyword appears in: H1, first 100 words, at least 2 H2s, meta description, closing paragraph
- Confirm secondary keywords are placed naturally throughout body (list where each one appears)
- Confirm semantic entities/LSI terms are woven in without stuffing

Schema opportunities:
- Note if HowTo, FAQ, Article, or Product schema is appropriate for this post

Internal linking summary:
- List all [INTERNAL LINK] placements with the target page description

External linking suggestions:
- Suggest 2–3 authoritative external sources to link (government, industry body, peer-reviewed study)

Image/alt text suggestions:
- List all [IMAGE PLACEHOLDER] slots with suggested alt text for each

---

STEP 6 — SELF-CHECK (run before outputting final version)

Score each item PASS or FAIL. Fix all FAILs before outputting.

Evidence & Accuracy:
□ Every major claim has a named, dated source or is flagged [NEEDS SOURCE]
□ All statistics are specific (exact percentages, dollar amounts, sample sizes)
□ No fabricated citations, journal names, or statistics
□ Sources are from the last 3–5 years where possible

Voice & Human Tone:
□ First two sentences would sound natural spoken aloud
□ Zero banned AI-tell words present (scan for: delve, landscape, tapestry, nuanced, crucial, unlock, seamless, robust, leveraging, moreover, furthermore)
□ At least one genuine personal/opinionated moment included
□ No three consecutive sentences of similar length

Structure & Readability:
□ Introduction is under 3 sentences and immediately engaging
□ Every subheading is specific, not generic
□ Every paragraph is 5 sentences or fewer
□ Closing delivers a clear takeaway or CTA — not a summary
□ Primary keyword in H1, first 100 words, 2+ H2s, meta description, closing

Fluff Test:
□ Every sentence teaches, clarifies, or advances the reader — nothing exists just to fill space
□ No hedging phrases ("it's important to note," "it should be mentioned")
□ No restated ideas in different words
□ No qualifiers that add nothing (very, really, extremely, quite, basically, essentially)

After fixing all FAILs, output the final clean post followed by the SEO block.
